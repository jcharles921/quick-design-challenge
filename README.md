## Array Manipulation Challenge 🤯 😵‍💫

### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous
subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists,
otherwise return false.

#### _solution can be found in the [`arrayMap.js`](./challenges/arrayMap.js) file._

### **_#️⃣ Note_ :**



I found the problem was already on leetcode so i just used the tests to check if my solution was correct and complient to the time and complexity constraints ; and it was Correct 🥳 🚀 🚀 🚀 !!!

## String Transformation 😘

### Problem Statement:

Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:

- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform
  both operations in the order specified above.
